!   In the example, we demonstrate to simulate growth of vacancy clusters.
!   First, we delete a W atom in a simulation box of perfect W crystal
!   containing 2000 W atoms. Then, W atoms in the neighboring region are 
!   sequentialy removed to create the vacancy cluster.
!   
!   The  simulations to be perfermed is GMD simulations. In addition of 
!   the control files for usual GMD simulations, control file (Growth_Ctrl_Vac.in)
!   for identifying the defect clusters is also required. We use the 
!   algorithm implemented in RefVoronoiVA_GPU to identify defect clusters.
!   The control file ReferenceLattice.in is similar to that of running 
!   RefVoronoiVA_GPU.
