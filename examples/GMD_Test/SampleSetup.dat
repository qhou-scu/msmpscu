!***********************************************************************
!   In the example, three simulation jobs to be conducted to simulate
!   the diffusion of He atom in W. 
!

! JOB#1 ***********************************************************************
!   the first job uses the BoxFile "W_2000_He1_FS_box.dat", in which
!   the potential is denoted as a FS potential. The temperature of 
!   the system is 500 K, . 
!

   &START_GMD  "pause"
     &BOXF  Simulation box setup file:  "W_2000_He1_FS_box.dat"
     &INIF Initial configuration file:  "W_2000_Tetra.cfg" 
     &CTLF  Control file:               "CtrlFile500K.dat"
     &COUT Filename output configures:  "500K_FS/Cfg"
   &END  

! JOB#2 ***********************************************************************
!   the second job uses the BoxFile "W_2000_He1_EAM1_box.dat", in which
!   the potential is denoted as internal-implemented EAM1 potential. 
!   The temperature of the system is 300 K. 
!   The initial configuration is the same as the JOB#1 
!  

   &START_GMD  "pause"
     &BOXF  Simulation box setup file:  "W_2000_He1_EAM1_box.dat"
     &INIF Initial configuration file:  "W_2000_Tetra.cfg" 
     &CTLF  Control file:               "CtrlFile300K.dat"
     &COUT Filename output configures:  "300K_EAM1/Cfg"
   &END  

! JOB#3 ***********************************************************************
!   the third job uses the BoxFile "W_2000_He1_EAM1T_box.dat", in which
!   the potential is denoted as loaded from a external potential 
!   (the potential is actually the same as that used in JOB#2).
!   The temperature of the system is 500 K. 
!
!   The inital configuration is load from the last outputs
!   of JOB#2, Because the configurations of boxes in one test
!   are output in seperated files (see CtrlFile300K.dat for 
!   the parameter setting of &OUTPUT_C, the initial configurations
!   for JOB#3 are load in multiple files, by setting variable 
!   of &INIF with "S"   
!  

   &START_GMD  "pause"
     &BOXF  Simulation box setup file:  "W_2000_He1_EAM1T_box.dat"
     &INIF Initial configuration file:  "300K_EAM1/Cfg", 13, "S"
     &CTLF  Control file:               "CtrlFile500K.dat"
     &COUT Filename output configures:  "500K_EAM1/Cfg"
   &END
