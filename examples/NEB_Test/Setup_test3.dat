!***********************************************************************
!   This is an example sample file for setup a NEB simulation. 
!   For a general description about setup file can be found in, 
!   the SampleSetup_general.dat in examples directory.
!
!   In this example, we perform NEB calculations for a serails
!   configurations that was created by EventSearch which
!   produce a number of jump events (see the example for Parallel_Replica
!   in examples\EventSearch
!

     !    We load the configurations from these files.
     !
     !*** To perform the serial NEB calculations, we set 
     !    extension range for the initial configurations,
     !    1, -4 in this example. 
     !    Note: in theis example, we set the end configuration 
     !          to be less than zero. This means that the program 
     !          will search the configurations until there is no
     !          more configurations on the trajecory.
