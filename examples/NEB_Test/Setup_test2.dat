!***********************************************************************
!   This is an example sample file for setup a NEB simulation. 
!   For a general description about setup file can be found in, 
!   the SampleSetup_general.dat in examples directory.
!
!   In this example, we perform NEB calculations for a serails
!   configurations that was created by paralell-replica MD which
!   produce a number of jump events (see the example for Parallel_Replica
!   in examples\PARREP

     !    We load the configurations from these files.
     !
     !    To perform the serial NEB calculations, we set 
     !    extension range for the initial configurations,
     !    1, 4 in this example.
