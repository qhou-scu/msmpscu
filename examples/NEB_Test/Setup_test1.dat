!   This is an example sample file for setup a NEB simulation. 
!   For a general description about setup file can be found in, 
!   the SampleSetup_general.dat in examples directory.
!
!   In this setup file, we first performed two GMD simulations
!   to create the reactant and product configurations. With these
!   two configuration, NEB calculation is perfomed
!

   !*** start a GMD simulation to created the first configuration.
   !    The initial configuration is a configuration obtained 
   !    by previous MD simulation with temperature. Now, we
   !    quench the configuration to zero temperature
