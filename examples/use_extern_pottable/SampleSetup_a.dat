!   This is a sample file for setup a simulation. You can write comments
!   and empty lines in the file. Each line with ! as the first character 
!   will be explained as a comment line(just like this line). 
!
!   The present file provides filenames for box setup and basic control 
!   parameters for a serials of simulations. The words starting with 
!   character '&' is a keyword. 
!   The case insensitive keyword $START indicates a start section of input 
!   for a simulation, the keyword $END  indeicates the end of the input 
!   section.

!   Following $START, a list of filenams could be given with corresponding
!   keywords. 
!   &BOXF indicates the box information by the given by string "xxxxxxx" in the line.
!   &INIF indicates the filename for the initial configuarion
!   &CTRF indicates the filename for controlling parameters
!   &TOUT indicates the filename for the output of thermal quantities
!   &COUT indicates the filename for the output of instant configuarions on time points
!   &SWAP indicates the filename for the binary output of current status of the system, 
!         which could used for restart.
!   &AUXF indicates the auxiliary filename(s) for other extended input or output
!     
!   The string variable for the filenames must be in form
!   using "xxxxx". 
!   The limiation of the number of auxiliary filenames is six.
