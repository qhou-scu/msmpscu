!   This is an example file for setup Cascade simulation, an applicattion
!   developed on the basis of MDPSCU.

!   Each line strating with chracter ! will be explained as a comment

!***********************************************************************
!   In the example, we demonstrate to simulate He atom incident on the W 
!   surface.
!   
!   The  simulations to be perfermed is GMD simulations. In addition of 
!   the control files for usual GMD simulations, an additional control 
!   file (Cascade_He_1keV.in), denoted by keyword &AUXF_DEPOSIT
!   for seting up projectile is also required. 
!
!****** first stage
!       At first, we prepare the substrate at a temperature 300K
!       This stage is just like running Substrate.exe
!      
   &START_GMD  "pause"
     &CTLF  Control file:               "CtrlFile300K.dat"
     &BOXF  Simulation box setup file:  "W_54000_He0_FS_box.dat"
     &INIF Initial configuration file:  "W_54000.cfg"
     &COUT Filename output configures:  "W_300K/" 
   &END    

!****** second stage
!       Second, we deposit an He atom to each box generated
!       in the first stage. The deposition parameter given 
!       by "Cascade_He_1keV.in"
!      
   &START_GMD  "pause"
     &CTLF  Control file:               "CtrlFile300K_LOC_T.dat"
     &BOXF  Simulation box setup file:  "W_54000_He0_FS_box.dat"   
     &INIF Initial configuration file:  "W_300K/P0000_0001.0020"  input vel= "yes"
     &COUT Filename output configures:  "He_1keV/" 
     &AUXF_DEPOSIT "Cascade_He_1keV.in"
   &END
