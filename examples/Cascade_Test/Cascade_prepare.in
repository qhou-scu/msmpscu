!***********************************************************************
!   This is a sample file of control file of running Cascade. 
!   This file is directed by SetupSampe_He.dat, provding parameters
!   for incident energies, type of incident atoms.
!
!   You can write comments and empty lines in the file. Each line with 
!   as the first character  will be explained as a comment line(just like this line). 
!
!   The input parameters are introduced by keywords. A default value
!   will be used for a parameter if its keyword dose not appear.
