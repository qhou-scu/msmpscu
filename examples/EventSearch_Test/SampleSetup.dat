!   This is an example file for setup EventSearch, which is an extension
!   of Generic MD simulation. In EventSearch, events are detected and 
!   the zero- and nonzero- temperature configurations at before and after 
!   events to be output.

!***********************************************************************
!   In the example, three simulation jobs to be conducted to simulate
!   the diffusion of He atom in W. 
!

! JOB#1 ***********************************************************************
!   the first job uses the BoxFile "W_2000_He1_FS_box.dat", in which
!   the potential is denoted as a FS potential. The temperature of 
!   the system is 500 K, .

     &COUT Filename output configures:  "500K_FS/Cfg"
   &END  

! JOB#2 ***********************************************************************
!   the second job uses the BoxFile "W_2000_He1_EAM1_box.dat", in which
!   the potential is denoted as internal-implemented EAM1 potential. 
!   The temperature of the system is 300 K. 
!   The initial configuration is the same as the JOB#1 
!  

   &START_GMD  "pause"

     &COUT Filename output configures:  "300K_EAM1/Cfg"
   &END  

! JOB#3 ***********************************************************************
!   the third job uses the BoxFile "W_2000_He1_EAM1T_box.dat", in which
!   the potential is denoted as loaded from a external potential 
!   (the potential is actually the same as that used in JOB#2).
!   The temperature of the system is 500 K. 
!
!   The inital configuration is load from the last outputs
!   of JOB#2  
!
