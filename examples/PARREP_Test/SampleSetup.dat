!   In the example, two simulation jobs to be conducted. 
!
!   These two jobs have the same control files and initial
!   configuration stored in file "W_2000_Tetra.cfg", which 
!   was previously generated by an other program. However,
!   the two jobs using different BoxFiles. 


!   The first job uses the BoxFile "W_2000_H1_EAM1_box.dat" 
!   to simulate the migration of H in W, with results placed
!   in the directory "W0K_Tetra_H1_EAM1".
