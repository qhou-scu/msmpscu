!   This is a sample file of control file of running Cluster_Growth. 
!   This file is directed by SetupSampe_He_Cluster.dat, provding parameters
!   for identifying defect cluster, and the insert atoms.
!
!   You can write comments and empty lines in the file. Each line with 
!   as the first character  will be explained as a comment line(just like this line). 
!
!   The input parameters are introduced by keywords. A default value
!   will be used for a parameter if its keyword dose not appear.

 !--- first, we should give the filename of reference configuration used for Wigner-Seitz 
 !    analysis of defect cluster
 &REFCFG filename of the reference configuration = "W_2000.cfg"
 
 !---  we should define the kind of cluster to grow. In this examples, 
 !     a defect cluster could be a vacancy cluster, or SIA cluster, or
 !     a combination cluster of SIA and impurity. The atoms of type 2
 !     is defined as impurity. 
 !      
 &DEFECTTYP impuritis 2, and "VAC", "SIA", "COMBCLUS"
 
 !--- Example of extended cluster: 
 !    
 !                         iii   
 !                        iieii
 !                       iieCeii 
 !                      iieCCCeii
 !                       iieCeii
 !                        iieii
 !                         iii
 !
 !    C indicating the cluster core W-S sites
 !    e denotes the extended shell constructed by W-S sites
 !    i denotes the insert shell constructed by W-S sites, in which new atom (vacancy) will be inserted (created)             
 !
 
 !---  In the neighbor region of the clusters, new atom of type 3 will 
 !     be insert 
 &INSTYP    atom type will be inserted is type 3
 
 &EXTSHELL  shell-layers that the cluster will extended for is 0 
 &INSSHELL  thick of shell-layer is 0
