!***********************************************************************
!   This is a sample file of control file of running Cluster_Growth. 
!   This file is directed by SetupSampe_Vac_Cluster.dat and provde 
!   parameters for identifying defect cluster, and the insert vacancy.
!
!***********************************************************************

 
 !--- first, we should give the filename of reference configuration used for 
 !    Wigner-Seitz analysis of defect cluster
 &REFCFG filename of the reference configuration = "W_2000.cfg"
 
 !---  we should define kind of cluster which will grows. In this examples, 
 !     a vacancy cluster will grow. Thus we have the following set  
 !      
 &DEFECTTYP the cluster will grow is: "VAC"
 
 !--- Example of extended cluster: 
 !
 !                         iii   
 !                        iieii
 !                       iieCCeii 
 !                      iieCCCeii
 !                       iieCCeii
 !                        iieeii
 !                         iii
 !
 !    C indicating the cluster core W-S sites
 !    e denotes the extended shell constructed by W-S sites
 !    i denotes the insert shell constructed by W-S sites, in which new atom (vacancy) will be inserted (created)  
 !           
 !--- NOTE: to insert a vacancy, the type shoule be < 0. In this example
 !          one atom of type 1 in the insert shell will be removed
 !
 &INSTYP    atom type will be inserted is type -1
 
 &EXTSHELL  the cluster will be extended for is 0 (shell layer)
 
 &INSSHELL  thick of insert shell is 1 (shell layer)

 !--- parameters control clustering
 &CLUSMETH         "USEDT"    0.6   (LU)
 &PROP_TYPE type to be used in clustering = "VAC"
 &SAVE_REFBOX if save refbox with clusters      "YES"
