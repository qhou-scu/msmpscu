!   In the example, we demonstrate to simulate growth of H clusters.
!   Frist, we insert an He atom in a simulation box of perfect W crystal
!   containing 2000 W atoms. Then, He atoms are sequentialy added to the 
!   neighboring region of the He (atom) cluster. 
!   
!   The  simulations to be perfermed is GMD simulations. In addition of 
!   the control files for usual GMD simulations, a control file (Growth_Ctrl_H.in)
!   for identifying the defect clusters is also required. We use the 
!   algorithm implemented in RefVoronoiVA_GPU to identify defect clusters.
!   The control file ReferenceLattice.in is similar to that of running 
!   RefVoronoiVA_GPU.
