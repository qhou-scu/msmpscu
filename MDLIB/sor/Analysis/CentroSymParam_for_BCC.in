!   This is a sample file controlling the calculation and output in
!   centro-symmetry-parameter calculations. You can write comments and 
!   empty lines in the file. Each line with ! as the first character 
!   will be explained as a comment line(just like this line). 
!
!   Between each line, one could add any lines of empty line
!   or comments
!   
!   The input parameters are introduced by keywords. A default value
!   will be used for a parameter if its keyword dose not appear.

!   KEYWORDS (common for most anaylysis tools): 
!     &QUICKDAMP     indicate if damping to be performed before running analysis routine
!                    = 1 for yes, =0 for no (default)
!                    example: QUICKDAMP  1
! 
!     &QUICKDUMP     the same as &QUICKDAMP
!
!     &JOBSEL        indicate which TESTs (ref to user guid) to be included in analysis.
!                    without this keyword, all TESTs will be analyzed.
!
!                    usage: &JOBSEL  J0, J1, JS
!                           where J0 is the id of the frist TEST
!                                 J1 is the id of the end  TEST
!                                 JS is the intervale of the TESTs
!
!                    example: &JOBSEL  1, 99, 2 indicating TESTs #1, #3, #5,...,#99 will be included for analyzing
!
!     &CFGSEL        indicate which configurations to be included in analysis for included TESTs
!                    without this keyword, all configurations will be analyzed.
!
!                    usage: &CFGSEL  C0, C1, CS
!                           where C0 is the id of the frist configuration in a test
!                                 C1 is the id of the end configuration in a test
!                                 CS is the intervale of the configurations
!
!                    example: &CFGSEL  5, 100, 5 indicating configuration #5, #10, ...,#100 will included for analyzing

!   KEYWORDS(specific): 
!   &AXSISX        the coordinate axsis X of simulation box, expressed by
!                  Miller crystal index.
!                  Without this input, X axsis will be (1,0,0)
!   &AXSISY        the coordinate axsis Y of simulation box, expressed by
!                  Miller crystal index
!                  Without this input, Y axsis will be (0,1,0)
!   &AXSISZ        the coordinate axsis Z of simulation box, expressed by
!                  Miller crystal index
!                  Without this input, Z axsis will be (0,0,1)
!   &CPLEVELS      NL, level1, levl2, ...
!                  where NL is the number of thresholds of CSP values, which
!                  can be used to distinguish atoms. This could be useful 
!                  for visualization. Without this input,
!                  the atoms will not be distinguished by CSP values.
!   CAL_CPAV       the time steps for output average CSP, if the parameter < 0 
!                  no average of CSPs will be output
!
