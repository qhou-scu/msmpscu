!   This is a sample file of control file of running Reflection application.
!   Reflection application is used to extract the refelction and transmission
!   coefficeints of energic atoms on a surface 
!
!   You can write comments and empty lines in the file. Each line with 
!   as the first character  will be explained as a comment line(just like this line). 
!
!   The input parameters are introduced by keywords. A default value
!   will be used for a parameter if its keyword dose not appear.

!   KEYWORDS (common for most anaylysis tools): 
!     &QUICKDAMP     indicate if damping to be performed before running analysis routine
!                    = 1 for yes, =0 for no (default)
!                    example: QUICKDAMP  1
! 
!     &QUICKDUMP     the same as &QUICKDAMP
!
!     &JOBSEL        indicate which TESTs (ref to user guid) to be included in analysis.
!                    without this keyword, all TESTs will be analyzed.
!
!                    usage: &JOBSEL  J0, J1, JS
!                           where J0 is the id of the frist TEST
!                                 J1 is the id of the end  TEST
!                                 JS is the intervale of the TESTs
!
!                    example: &JOBSEL  1, 99, 2 indicating TESTs #1, #3, #5,...,#99 will be included for analyzing
!
!     &CFGSEL        indicate which configurations to be included in analysis for included TESTs
!                    without this keyword, all configurations will be analyzed.
!
!                    usage: &CFGSEL  C0, C1, CS
!                           where C0 is the id of the frist configuration in a test
!                                 C1 is the id of the end configuration in a test
!                                 CS is the intervale of the configurations
!
!                    example: &CFGSEL  5, 100, 5 indicating configuration #5, #10, ...,#100 will included for analyzing
