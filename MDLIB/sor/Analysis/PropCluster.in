!   This is a sample file of control file of running PropCluster 
!   applications. The atoms will be clustered by theire given 
!   properties and connection in space. 
!
!   You can write comments and empty lines in the file. Each line with 
!   as the first character  will be explained as a comment line(just like this line). 
!
!   The input parameters are introduced by keywords. A default value
!   will be used for a parameter if its keyword dose not appear.

!
!     &CFGSEL        indicate which configurations to be included in analysis for included TESTs
!                    without this keyword, all configurations will be analyzed.

!                                 CS is the intervale of the configurations
!

!   KEYWORDS (specific): 
!     &METHOD       indicate which method to be used to determine the connection
!                   between atoms.
!
!                   usage: &METHOD  name parameters
!                          where name is a string "USEDT" (default) or "USEBD". 
!                          If name = "USEDT", the connection to be determined by Delaunay tessllation.
!                             If a string "SAVE_DV" appears after "USEDT", the intermediate result
!                             of Delaunay vertices will be output to a file (this could be time consuming).  
!                          If name = "USEBD", the bond length will be used to determine the connections.
!                             If without parameter, the bond length will be the force cutoff distance;
!                             If the parameter is a real number, then the parameter will be used
!                             as the bond length. The input bond length is in latticed unit.
!                   example1: &METHOD "USEDT"
