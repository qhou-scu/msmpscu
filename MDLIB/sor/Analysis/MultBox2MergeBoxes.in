!   KEYWORDS (common for most anaylysis tools): 
!     &QUICKDAMP     indicate if damping to be performed before running analysis routine
!                    = 1 for yes, =0 for no (default)
!                    example: QUICKDAMP  1
! 
!     &QUICKDUMP     the same as &QUICKDAMP
!
!     &JOBSEL        indicate which TESTs (ref to user guid) to be included in analysis.
!                    without this keyword, all TESTs will be analyzed.
!
!                    usage: &JOBSEL  J0, J1, JS
!                           where J0 is the id of the frist TEST
!                                 J1 is the id of the end  TEST
!                                 JS is the intervale of the TESTs
!
!                    example: &JOBSEL  1, 99, 2 indicating TESTs #1, #3, #5,...,#99 will be included for analyzing
!
!     &CFGSEL        indicate which configurations to be included in analysis for included TESTs
!                    without this keyword, all configurations will be analyzed.
!
!                    usage: &CFGSEL  C0, C1, CS
!                           where C0 is the id of the frist configuration in a test
!                                 C1 is the id of the end configuration in a test
!                                 CS is the intervale of the configurations
!
!                    example: &CFGSEL  5, 100, 5 indicating configuration #5, #10, ...,#100 will included for analyzing

!   KEYWORDS (specific): 
!
!     &PROP_TYPE    indicating the type(s) of atoms will in used in merging and
!                   the program will checking if type of atoms are available. 
!                   Without this keyword, the checking will not performed.
!
!                   usage:  &PROP_TYPE typ1, type2.
!                   example:&PROP_TYPE 2, 4, indicating atoms of type 2 and type 4 will be
!                           used in clustering.  
!
!     &PROP_EPOT    indicating the potential(s) of atoms will in used in merging boxes
!                   the program will checking if potential of atoms are available. 
!                   Without this keyword, the checking will not performed.

!                   usage: &PROP_EPOT ( E0, E1 ), ( E2, E3 )...
!                          where the parameters E0, E1... (in eV) define a number of energy range 
!                          that could be used in clustering.
!                   example:&PROP_EPOT ( 0.1, 0.5 ), ( 1.5, 1.8)...
!
!     &PROP_EKIN    indicating the kinetic energy(s) of atoms will in used in merging boxes and.
!                   the program will checking if kinetic energy(s) of atoms are available. 
!                   Without this keyword, the checking will not performed.
