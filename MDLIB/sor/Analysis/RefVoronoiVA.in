!   This is a sample file of control file of running RefVoronoiVATool. 
!
!   You can write comments and empty lines in the file. Each line with 
!   as the first character  will be explained as a comment line(just like this line). 
!
!   The input parameters are introduced by keywords. A default value
!   will be used for a parameter if its keyword dose not appear.

!   KEYWORDS (common for most anaylysis tools): 
!     &QUICKDAMP     indicate if damping to be performed before running analysis routine
!                    = 1 for yes, =0 for no (default)
!                    example: QUICKDAMP  1
! 
!     &QUICKDUMP     the same as &QUICKDAMP
!
!     &JOBSEL        indicate which TESTs (ref to user guid) to be included in analysis.
!                    without this keyword, all TESTs will be analyzed.
!
!                    usage: &JOBSEL  J0, J1, JS
!                           where J0 is the id of the frist TEST
!                                 J1 is the id of the end  TEST
!                                 JS is the intervale of the TESTs
!
!                    example: &JOBSEL  1, 99, 2 indicating TESTs #1, #3, #5,...,#99 will be included for analyzing
!
!     &CFGSEL        indicate which configurations to be included in analysis for included TESTs
!                    without this keyword, all configurations will be analyzed.
!
!                    usage: &CFGSEL  C0, C1, CS
!                           where C0 is the id of the frist configuration in a test
!                                 C1 is the id of the end configuration in a test
!                                 CS is the intervale of the configurations
!
!                    example: &CFGSEL  5, 100, 5 indicating configuration #5, #10, ...,#100 will included for analyzing

!   KEYWORDS (specific): 
!
!     &REFCFG        indication of the filename of the reference configurqation.
!                    if the reference configuration is not assigned explicitly, 
!                    the configuration at zero time step will be the reference
!                    configuration.
!
!                    usage:   &REFCFG filename
!
!                    example: &REFCFG "Myreference.crystal"
!
!     &METHOD        indication of the method used to identify the occupation 
!                    of the reference sites. 
!
!                    usage:   &METHOD = name rad
!                             where name is a string "USEVT" (default) or "USEST". 
!                             If name = "USEVT", a site is indentified as occupied if there is 
!                                one or more atoms is closer to the site than to other sites.
!                                the site is actually a Voronoi site.  
!                             If name = "USEST", a site is identified as occupied if ther is 
!                                an atom is in a sphere region of given raidu cenered by the 
!                                site. rad is the raidu of the sphere region.
!                    example1: &METHOD "USEVT"
!                    example2: &METHOD "USEST"  rad
!
!     &CALFOR        indication if local force to be also calculated and output
!                    = 0 for no (default), = 1 for yes
!                    This parameter take  effects only when METHOS is "USEVT"
!
!     &CALPOT        indication if local potential to be also calculated and output 
!                    = 0 for no (default), = 1 for yes
!                    This parameter take  effects only when METHOS is "USEVT"
!
!     &CALKEN        indication if local kinetic energy to be also calculated and output 
!                    = 0 for no (default), = 1 for yes
!
!                    This parameter take  effects only when METHOS is "USEVT"
!     $CALSTRESS     indication if local stress to be also calculate and output
!   
!     &AUXF_RVVOUT   indicating of filename of for outputing results. If the filename is
!                    given here, the filename2 (if given in SETUP file) will be replaced.
