!   This is a sample file for setup a simulation. You can write comments
!   and empty lines in the file. Each line with ! as the first character 
!   will be explained as a comment line(just like this line). 
!
!   The present file provides filenames for box setup and basic control 
!   parameters for a serials of simulations. The words starting with 
!   character '&' is a keyword. 
!
!   The case insensitive keyword $START_XXX indicates a start section of input 
!   for a simulation, the keyword $END  indeicates the end of the input 
!   section. "_XXX" indicates what kind of application to be run. "_XXX"
!   coould be one of the follows:
!
!      $START, $START_GMD - a generic MD simulation to be performed   
!      $START_PARREP      - a paralell-replica MD simulation to be performed   
!      $START_NEB         - a NEB simulation to be performed   
!
!   Following the $START statement, a list of filenams should be given with 
!   corresponding keywords. 
!
!   The must-given files forall kinds of applications:  
!   &BOXF indicates the filename providing box information.
!   &CTLF indicates the filename for controlling parameters
!   &INIF indicates the filename for the initial configuarion
!   &COUT indicates the filename for the output of produced configuarions in the 
!        simulation
!
!   The optional files:    
!   &SWAP indicates the filename for the binary output of current status of the system, 
!         which could be used for restart after accident interruption. Without giving this
!         filename, a default filename starting with "swap" will be created in the same 
!         directory of &COUT files.  
!   &TGTF indicates the filename for the product configuarion for NEB calculation. 
!         NEB calculations can be also run in a serial mode. In this mode, the
!         keyword &TGTF should be omitted
!   &TOUT indicates the filename for the output of thermal quantities. Without giving this
!         filename, a default filename starting with "therm" will be created in the same 
!         directory of &COUT files.
!
!   &AUXF indicates the auxiliary filename(s) for other extended input or output. 
!              
!     
!   Note: The string variable for the filenames must be in form "xxxxx".
