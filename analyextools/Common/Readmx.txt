!********************************************
APPNAME:     ChangePType.F90
DESCRIPTION: The program is used to change type of particle from one type to antoher
BUILD:       gapp ChangePType.F90 
USAGE:       ChangePType.exe -I "filename" -t(est) t1, t2, ts -c(fg) c1, c2, cs -p pt1 pt2 
             OPTIONS    -T(est) t1, t2:   - the range for the tests to be involved in analysis
                        -C(fg)  c1, c2:   - the range for the configurations to be involved
                        -p pt1 pt2        - change pt1, the original type to type pt2  
OUTPUT:      Configurations with the particle type changed to be output to files with filename "filenam"_CHP_P
HISTORY:     1st version   2019-07 (Hou Qing Sichuan university)

!********************************************
APPNAME:     DelPType.F90
DESCRIPTION: The program is used to delete give type of particles from the box
BUILD:       gapp DelPType.F90 
USAGE:       DelPType.ex -I "filename" -t(est) t1, t2, ts -c(fg) c1, c2, cs -p pt
             OPTIONS    -T(est) t1, t2:   - the range for the tests to be involved in analysis
                        -C(fg)  c1, c2:   - the range for the configurations to be involved
                        -p pt              -the type to be deleted from the configuration
OUTPUT:      Configurations with the particles of type pt deleted to be output to files with filename "filenam"_DELP_P
HISTORY:     1st version   2019-07 (Hou Qing Sichuan university)

APPNAME:     InsertBox.F90
DESCRIPTION: The program is to insert a configuration to the configurations generated by MD simulations.
             For example inset the tetrahedraon lattices to the MD configurations for the convenience
             of visual inspectionn
BUILD:       gapp InsertBox.F90 
USAGE:       InsertBox.F90.exe -I "filename" -t(est) t1, t2, ts -c(fg) c1, c2, cs -ins "boxfile"
                  where:
                        filename:     the filename of MD configurations
                        t1, t2, ts:   the range for the tests to be involved in analysis
                        c1, c2, cs:   the range for the configurations to be involved in analysis
                        boxfile       the filename name of the configuration to be inserted
                        
OUTPUT:      Configurations with the filename "filenam"_INS_P
HISTORY:   version 1st 2019-07 (Hou Qing, Sichuan university)
